This document represents the objectives that we plan to implement to create ac circuit solver .
\end{abstract}

\section{Objectives }

  (FOR PART 1)


-Given the netlist,we parse the input file and collects information i.e       magnitude of components and NET points between which they are connected. 


-Output file outputs an svg drawing of the AC circuit with the all NET points defined in space and all the components likewise resistors,capacitors,inductors,voltage source,current source connected to each other as defined by input file. 

(FOR PART 2)


It also ouputs text file with  the current and voltage in each component of  AC circuit. 

\section{Additional features }

-The final output file contains a button at top left which allows the user
 to toggle page in all four direction i.e up,down,left,right
 
 - it also contain a button to zoom in or out.
